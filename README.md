# hclq

hclq is a command line tool for querying and manipulating [HashiCorp HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) files, such as those used by [Terraform](https://terraform.io). It's similar to [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), but for HCL. In addition to retrieving values, hclq can also modify values. By default, hclq returns `get` results as JSON, which can be further processed by jq or some other means. It also has a raw mode for unformatted output.
